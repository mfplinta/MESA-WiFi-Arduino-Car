# Arduino Wi-Fi Car - ESP8266

Code for the Arduino Car Competition for MESA Lagoon Day 2019 in Utah.

### Accolades:

* ESP8266 hosts the server that receives commands from a client laptop.

* Coded overnight, but worked reliably, resulting in a victory for our team in the Arduino Car competition.

Code for the client application in root of repo, and code for the Arduino car in `Arduino` folder.
